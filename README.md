# ECE-391

This directory will hold lecture notes that aren't just repeating what the slides say (at least that's the goal), and maybe some other stuff. Mainly, it should be used in conjunction with the slides to help people out (again, goal). Any feedback is nice, email is mgarc67@illinois.edu or if you have me on Facebook, that works too.

# v0.1

Initial set of notes, not yet complete but has a decent amount in it right now.

# v0.2

Added a section, may end up changing stuff about it later though. Formatting changes in earlier sections too.

# ECE-391

This directory will hold lecture notes for my school's operating systems class, ECE 391, that aren't just repeating what the slides say (at least that's the goal), and maybe some other stuff in the future. Mainly, it should be used in conjunction with the slides to help people out (again, goal). Any feedback is nice, email is mgarc67@illinois.edu or if you have me on Facebook, that works too. All the old versions with major changes will be in the folder, while the most current one will be in the main directory (this one).

## v0.4

On Discussion 5/Week 10, slowly but surely updating more stuff. Revisions, lecture 9 added (short), overall minor update.

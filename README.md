# ECE-391

This directory will hold lecture notes for my school's operating systems class, ECE 391, that aren't just repeating what the slides say (at least that's the goal), and maybe some other stuff in the future. Mainly, it should be used in conjunction with the slides to help people out (again, goal). Any feedback is nice, email is mgarc67@illinois.edu or if you have me on Facebook, that works too. (Will start working on it again soon no lies) (Edit: I lied about soon, but hopefully more will be added for people in fall 2020)

## v0.6
Almost finished with lecture 15, moving to lecture 16 soon. Note: has more typos than expected and some info that could be considered misniformation (my b) when talking about PAE in lecture 15 (mainly one line I see right now talking about CR3). Will fix in next update.
